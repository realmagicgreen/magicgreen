The findings show that 90% of millennials will buy from a brand whose social and environmental practices they trust, and 95% of them will recommend that brand to a friend.

Considering millennials spend a $600 billion per year, a figure that's expected to grow to $1.4 trillion, which is 30% of the market, those numbers have a huge significance for brands.

They named Patagonia, Whole Foods, Tesla, Apple and The Honest Company as some of their most-trusted brands, all of which have notable social or environmental practices. Even Walmart made the list for its recent sustainability initiatives.
