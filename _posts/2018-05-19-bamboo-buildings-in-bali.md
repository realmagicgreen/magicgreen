The Indonesian island of Bali is witnessing a new trend. Bamboo building, emblem of sustainable construction, are replacing concrete and steel with far greener alternatives.

Bamboo, technically a grass, has been used in building for centuries due to its impressive strength-to-weight ratio.

Bamboo is not seen as the poor man's timber anymore. Not far from the smoggy Bali capital Denpasar new ambitious bamboo projects are growing, mostly driven by eco-conscious foreigners and big resorts.

>**"Bamboo is unmatched as a sustainable building material. What it can do is remarkable. It grows far more quickly than timber and doesn't destroy the land it's grown on"** Ben Ripple, Big Tree Farms Bali co-founder.

Resorts, school, villas and even a chocolate factory structures in the Indonesian island are putting bamboo to work, showing excellent examples of a sustainable way to build.

Studies show construction is one of the world's least sustainable industries, eating up around half of the globe's non-renewable resources, but sustainable construction is slowly taking root around the world.

One reason bamboo is so environmentally-friendly is the speed at which it grows, according to Terry Sunderland, a scientist at the Centre for International Forestry Research in Indonesia.

>**"Building-quality bamboo will grow between six and 10 meters in that time,"** Terry Sunderland.

Around 200 farmers across the island are paid to grow bamboo on areas of their land not used for agriculture. Some of the largest logs are 25 meters long but only take 3 years to grow.

>**"Many people still think bamboo is cheap and only for small buildings, but we're showing it can be used to make high houses and really redefine how the material is used."**

Bamboo has its drawbacks. Without intensive treatment, it is prone to rotting and catches fire relatively easily, which is why many countries limit bamboo structures height.

Building with bamboo is not fool proof, but technologies to protect it from the elements are rapidly improving.

>**"We treat each piece of bamboo with a mixture of water and boric acid to stop fungus and insects. Before doing this a bamboo structure would last only seven years, now we're not sure how long a building can last."** Mokoho Sumerta, Bamboo Factory Bali
