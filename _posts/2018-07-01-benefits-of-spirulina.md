Spirulina was consumed by the Aztecs back in the day, but became popular again when NASA proposed that it could be grown in space and [used by astronauts](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890016190.pdf).

Often used as a supplement to the diets due to the well-researched and diverse health benefits, Spirulina is a fantastic source of antioxidants, which can protect against oxidative damage.  

It can lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, while raising HDL (the "good") cholesterol. It protects LDL cholesterol from becoming oxidized.  

Spirulina may have some anti-cancer properties, especially against a type of precancerous lesion called OSMF (Oral Submucous Fibrosis).
