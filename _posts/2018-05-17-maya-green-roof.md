Designed by award-winning architect, Budiman Hendropurnomo of Denton Corker Marshall, Maya Sanur Resort feature an innovative design that elevates aesthetics to exciting new heights.

Structurally, the resort is sheltered by a stunning rooftop garden with a collection of intimate spaces and inspiring lagoon views beneath.

Recycled water is used to irrigate the garden, and energy-efficient LED lighting are used throughout the hotel. In addition, materials such as recycled teak and sand were used in the building process.

Innovative charcoal ceilings throughout the reception atrium are not only visually stimulating, but naturally absorb sound and cleanse the air.
