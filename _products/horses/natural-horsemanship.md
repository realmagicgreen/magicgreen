Natural Horsemanship is a philosophy of working with horses based on the horse's natural instincts and their methods of communication.

Natural Horsemanship emphasizes the understanding that horses do not learn through fear or pain, but rather through pressure and release of pressure.

Horsemanship is the art of mastering our own movements, thoughts, emotions and behavior.

>Working with horses helps develop positive values and life skills that are transferred to a person's daily life.

Learning to read the body language of horses and communicate with them in their language is a fascinating journey.

Horses are prey animals. In the wild they live in herds. The horse they trust and follow in the herd is not the aggressive stallion, but a life experienced mare.

The goal of becoming a good horseman / woman is to gain the qualities of the leading - trustworthy mare.

During her studies Sabine realized the huge effect this program had and still has on her personal growth.

Horses are extremely sensitive animals who reflect our behavior. Horses follow people who are focused, aware and who present a calm, soft and strong energy.

Through the program students will work on emotional and physical fitness.
