The Indonesian island of Bali is witnessing a new trend. Bamboo building, emblem of sustainable construction, are replacing concrete and steel with far greener alternatives.

Bamboo, technically a grass, has been used in building for centuries due to its impressive strength-to-weight ratio. Ratio of tensile resistance to specific weight is 6 times greater than that of steel, and it withstands compression better than concrete. Unlike trees that rarely grow back once cut, bamboo will continue to produce new shoots even after harvesting it.

Bamboo is not seen as the poor man's timber anymore. Not far from the smoggy capital Denpasar new ambitious bamboo projects are growing in Bali, mostly driven by eco-conscious foreigners and big resorts.

>**"Bamboo is unmatched as a sustainable building material. What it can do is remarkable. It grows far more quickly than timber and doesn't destroy the land it's grown on"** Big Tree Farms co-founder Ben Ripple.

Resorts, school, villas and even a chocolate factory structures use bamboo skeletons for his  strength. Some projects include innovative bamboo flooring that resembles smooth timber and jellybean-shaped coffee tables made from thin bamboo slats.

Studies show construction is one of the world's least sustainable industries, eating up around half of the globe's non-renewable resources, but sustainable construction is slowly taking root around the world.

One reason bamboo is so environmentally-friendly is the speed at which it grows, according to Terry Sunderland, a scientist at the Centre for International Forestry Research in Indonesia.

>**"In China, eucalyptus can grow at three to four metres a year, which is very impressive for timber. But building-quality bamboo will grow between six and 10 metres in that time,"** Terry Sunderland.

Bamboo has its drawbacks. Without intensive treatment, it is prone to rotting and catches fire relatively easily, which is why many countries limit bamboo structures height.

The best time to [harvest bamboo](https://www.guaduabamboo.com/cultivation/when-and-how-to-harvest-bamboo) is at the end of the dry season in your area. Starch content is at its highest during this season, making parasite and fungal attacks less likely.

Studies show remarkable differences with untreated bamboo, when harvested at specific hours and moon. The starch content is lowest when the moon is closer to earth, providing higher gravitation. Due to the moon elliptic orbit this is not related to the moon phase, as popular beliefs suggest.

The best time to harvest bamboo, is before sunrise, when most of the starch is still in the roots. This way has 3 advantages: they are less attractive to insects, are less heavy to transport and will dry faster. To reduce starch sometimes bamboo is also soaked for 90 days before further treatments.

Only mature bamboo, between 4 and 7 years old, is harvested. Poles inside the clump are older than those growing outside. An experienced bamboo harvester will be able to tell the age of bamboo by knocking on the culm and listening the different sounds.

Building with bamboo is not fool proof, but technologies to protect it from the elements are rapidly improving.

Hight heat is used to [cure the bamboo](https://www.wikihow.com/Cure-Bamboo). The bamboo will change color slightly. Resin will rise to the surface, making it stronger. Resin is rubbed into the bamboo culms. The color will slowly change from deep green to mint green.

Holes are then poked in its inner membranes to quicken [the drying process](https://www.guaduabamboo.com/preservation/drying-bamboo-poles). The culms are stored away from direct soil to prevent fungal or insect infestations and away from direct sunlight, as moisture will damage it.  

Bamboo is then covered with a tarp and provided decent air ventilation. Vertical stacking lessens the chance of a fungal infection. But sturdier support system is needed to prevent bending.

Horizontal stacking works better for large stacks. A thick, plastic sheet is placed under each stacks prevent fungal infections. Poles are rotated every 15 days. This assures culms will dry in a uniform fashion. Bamboo should be dry in 6 to 12 weeks.

When it loses its glossy appearance its restored by gently oiling and waxing the bamboo once the drying process is finished.

To [remove bamboo mold](https://www.guaduabamboo.com/preservation/how-to-remove-bamboo-mold), lemon oil or a solution of vinegar and water can be used. Bamboo furniture usually 3 coats of polyurethane is applied to ensure the conservation of the furniture after treating it with turpentine and dried out completely.
