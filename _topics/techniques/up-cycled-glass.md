A clever way to limit the use of plastic bottles is serving water in up-cycled bottle and glasses.

These technique adopted by Warung Santai in Sanur has permitted them to completely eliminate their plastic bottle garbage.

Both glasses and bottle are made by cutting old glass bottles. They even use old glass bottle to diffuse the bulb lights installed in their facility.
