Sabine grew up with horses and made her passion for horses into a life style, when she started The Umalas Equestrian Resort in Bali in 1995. The UER offered tours and traditional lessons horse riding. Sabine managed the resort with over 30 horses for 17 years.

>In 2012 she closed the resort to follow a different path with horses from traditional horse riding to Natural Horsemanship.

With the goal of communicating and riding horses without any force, she started to learn Natural Horsemanship with Sandra Ragazzi an exquisite master in her field.

After 3 years of intensive studies with the support of Sandra, Sabine now teaches horsemanship classes with her own horses, as well as training other horse owners with their horses.
