## Dev Time

Store photos, at least 2000x1333px, .tif or .jpg, in ```/src/_p-hi```  
Copy those to process into:   

- ```/src/p_input``` if not yet lowercase, or  
- ```/src/p_lowercase``` if already all lowercase , or  
- ```/src/p_jpeg```if already .jpg

Then use:

```gulp lower``` to lowercase all photo names

```gulp tifs``` to produce jpg from tifs

```gulp jpgs``` to produce sized copies


Also can use [grafickmagik](http://aheckmann.github.io/gm/docs.html) to work photos 1 by 1, from CLI, like this:

```gm convert pippa-01.tif pippa-01.jpg```

Run Jekyll:

```bundle exec Jekyll serve ```

or to see error traces:  

```bundle exec Jekyll serve --trace```

## LIMITS (BUGS?!)

Tried jekyll-responsive-image but it sucks, this is not working:

```
{% capture path %} {{ page.image }} {% endcapture %}

{% responsive_image_block %}
   path: {{ path }}
{% endresponsive_image_block %}
```

there an [open issue here](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/jekyll-responsive-image/issues/70) ...
